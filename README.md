## Description
This is a Google Chrome Extension that will allow you to find a GIF that matches the PR you are opening or editing.

## Why?
Why not?

## Not, seriously... Why?
Because sometimes a GIF make things funnier, and you would never think what your PR might mean in the GIF world.

## Technologies within
Under the hood you will find React and Emotion.

## How to install
Install it from here: [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gif-for-github-pull-reque/gfjohbpkkbbflchpioebapldlmiflfho?hl=es-419)

## How it works In Github
1. Open a PR in your favorite repo with your awesome new feature or fix.
2. Press the **Have Fun!** button to unveil a whole new dimension of GIFs
3. If you think the proposed GIF is good enough, Just click the **Add GIF** button. If not, just request **Moar GIF**!
4. Happy merging!

## How it works in the rest of the Internet
1. Click on the Octocat icon in the extension bar.
2. Type your terms of search.
3. Flush until you see the GIF you love.
4. Share!


## I have an idea for a new feature, how can I contribute?
Feel free to open a PR(and don't forget your GIF) with the proposal. In case it is approved, I will release the new version in the Chrome App Store
