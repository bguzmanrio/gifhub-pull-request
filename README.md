## Desrcription
This is a Google Chrome Extension that will allow you to find a GIF that matches with the PR you are opening or editing.

## Why?
Why not?

## Not, seriously... Why?
Because sometimes a GIF make things funnier, and you would never think what your PR might mean in the GIF world.

## How is it made
Under the hood you will find React and Emotion.

## How it works
1. Install the extension
2. Open a PR in your favorite repo with your awesome new feature or fix
3. Open the extension. It will detect the title of your PR automagically and will search a random GIF according to the title.
4. If you think the proposed GIF is good enough, You could either copy the MD code or insert it directly in your PR!
5. That's all!

## How to install
Since I am using a development key for the Giphy API, the extension is only available for the users I choose. If you want to give it a try, contact me, and I will add you to the allowed user list

## I have an idea for a new feature, how can I contribute?
Feel free to open a PR(and don't forget your GIF) with the proposal. In case it is approved, I will release the new version in the Chrome App Store
